Meeting Protocol

_@Issue 000_
Development environment is working fine and we think we made a great choice with the technology (Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Hibernate, Bootstrap, MySQL).

_@Issue 001_
Database is also running. We can start to implement next Issues (since we are ahead of time):

* things that go well according to all members:

  * all closed issues are working well
  * Framework is perfect for our implementation
  
* things to improve:

  * focus more on branches
  * focus more on the agile workflow
  * pay attention to naming conventions in GitHub
  * pay attention to the "coding standard"
    
Also:

*	code should be easy to read
* use more comments on parts that are not obvious.
